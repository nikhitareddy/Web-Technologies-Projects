HW 4 : "airlinelist.zip" - Contains an airlinelist.html which is a HTML/JavaScript program, which takes the URL of  a  JSON  document  containing  US Airlines  information,  parses  the  JSON file,  and  extracts  the  list  of  airlines,  displaying  them  in  a  table.  The JavaScript  program  will  be  embedded  in  an  HTML  file  so  that  it  can  be executed within a browser.

HW 6: "search.php" is an php web application for implementing facebook search. In  this  exercise,  I have created  a  webpage  that  allows  you  to  search  for  information about  a  set  of  Facebook  entities  (i.e.,  users,  pages,  events,  places,  and  groups)  using  the Facebook Graph API, and the results will be displayed in a tabular format.
